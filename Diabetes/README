The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Here are the attributes: (all numeric-valued)
   1. Number of times pregnant
   2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   7. Diabetes pedigree function
   8. Age (years)
   9. Class variable (0 or 1)
   
I did hyperparameter tuning of the regularizers (L2 and dropout) of the Keras model to perform classification using real-life dataset with improved accuracy. I also determined the optimal batch_size and epochs.
